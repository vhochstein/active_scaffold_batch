ActiveScaffold batch is a gem which adds batch_update, batch_delete and
batch_destroy actions to activescaffold, which means you can perform
operations on more than just one record.

This fork is intended to also work with the official active_scaffold gem found
at github.com/activescaffold/active_scaffold by modifying the original
gemspec.


Rails 3.1 Gem:
gem 'active_scaffold_batch', :git => 'git://github.com/courtland/active_scaffold_batch.git'
